My First Hackathon
Last Saturday, I had the chance to participate in a Mini Hackathon organized by `Sunway Tech Club`, `Logitech` and `GDG Cloud KL`, with `AMD` sponsoring laptops and lucky draw prizes. We also had the opportunity to use the new Logitech MX Master 4 mouse, equipped with haptic feedback, it was definitely worth the hype.

I had the honour to be a part of a dedicated and collaborative team alongside `Tan Wen Zhe`, `Joe`, `Adam` and `Pei Jia`. Together, we built a fully local LLM using `Ollama`, `Gemma3`, `ChromaDB` and `Streamlit`. No API calls, no internet delays, completely offline and private. To enhance user experience, we also created a UI using `React`, which provided more flexibility and control compared to `Streamlit`.

Much appreciation goes to `Spyros Kyriazatis` and `Leong Lai Fong` for their active interactions with participants, guiding us throughout the hackathon.

Overall, it was a very exciting and fun event. Definitely looking forward to participating in more hackathons and continue learning from the community.
