My First Hackathon
Last Saturday (8 November 2025), I participated in the `Logitech Mini Hackathon` organized by `Sunway Tech Club`, `Logitech` and `GDG Cloud KL`.

I had the honour to be a part of an elite team alongside `Tan Wen Zhe`, `Joe`, `Adam` and `Pei Jia`.

We built a local LLM using `Ollama`, `Gemma3` and `Streamlit`, completely offline. We also designed and created a fantastic UI with `React`, aiming to enhance user experience.

Much appreciation goes to `Spyros Kyriazatis` and `Leong Lai Fong` for their active interactions with participants, guiding us throughout the process.

The haptic feedback on the Logitech MX Master 4 is game-changing, enhancing developers' productivity.

Last but not least, thank you `AMD` for the lucky draw gifts.
